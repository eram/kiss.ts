# KISS.TS
The Keep It Simple Stack (wish list)
See presentsaton here: https://www.slideshare.net/ethanram/kissts-the-keep-it-simple-software-stack 

__Technology Requirements__
1. Few technologies and languages to master >> enables small full-stack teams
1. Few infrastructure components fully integrated into a DevOps platform
1. Easy componentization of code, modules, services and apps.
1. Mature enough to be used in corporate software
1. Simple to start working with and use
1. Scalable and performant
1. Open standards 
1. Open-source (free) infra with an active community
1. Package manager
1. Deploy on Cloud and on-Prem.

__One Coding Language__
that one can use to do all of...
1. Scripted and typed
1. Backend, frontend and build
1. Dev, Test and Devops
1. Unit test, Integration Test
1. Excellent dev tools
1. Opinionated

__The KISS.TS - Base Stack__
1. TypeScript - Simple but strong, scripted and typed, frontend and backend, excellent toolset and linter \[Microsoft]
1. ReactJS - componentized modern frontend development \[Facebook]
1. NodeJS - performant JavaScript-based runtime environment with excellent componentization and package manager \[Node Foundation]
1. Koa Server - a server framework based on pluggable middleware using async-await model.
1. PostgreSQL - The only open-source DB that is both RDBMS and Not-only-SQL: ACID, web-scale, No-SQL feature set \[PostgreSQL Global Development Group]
1. Docker Containers - a SW packager and a virtualization layer that simplifies delivery and lower the cost of running a product \[Docker]


A bit into details of the toolset - - 


__Dev Suite__
1. NodeJS
1. TypeScript
